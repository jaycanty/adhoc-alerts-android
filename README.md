2011 graduate project

Created an adhoc network 
- ip assigning
- delegation of peer to peer responsibilities (Based on Bubble Wrap social protocol)
- asynchronous delivery of text to nodes over udp sockets

Build for Android 2.2 on the following rooted devices
- Motorola Droid 2
- HTC Eris

Direct access to specific wireless drivers made portability an issue
